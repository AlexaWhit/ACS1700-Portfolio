            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Alexa Whitney, and I live in Loveland, Colorado. I am newly married (December 2021) 
            and have three fur-children: Bruno (13 year old Shih Tzu), Ifrit (8 year old Shiba Inu), and 
            Freya (6 month old Persian kitten and the Princess of the family). I was born in Denver, Colorado 
            but have lived in several other states including Wisconsin, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland. My husband and I 
            moved back to Colorado this summer after a year in Maryland/Washington, D.C. and we are so excited to be back 
            in the Rocky Mountains! We enjoy hiking, sampling craft beers/eating at new restaurants, and attending concerts. 
            My personal goal this year is to learn how to roller-skate so that I can join the local roller derby team!</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Florida State University with a BS in Criminology and after 10 years I went to Colorado State University online and completed my
                    MS in Criminal Justice Administration while working full time. I am now back in school for a third time to obtain my BS in Applied Computer Science through Dominican University of California's online accelerated program.

                <h3>Criminal Justice</h3>
                <p>For the last 13 years I have teetered back and forth between probation and the courthouse. Specifically, I was a Probation Officer for misdemeanor
                    <abbr title="Driving Under the Influence">DUI</abbr> and <abbr title="Domestic Violence">DV</abbr> cases and was also the Senior Court Clerk and Deputy Court Administrator (Court Manager) for a municipality in Colorado, and then moved to Washington,D.C. where I
                    was the Courtroom Deputy for the Honorable Judge Florence Y. Pan with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. I worked one block away from the Capital 
                    building, so you can imagine how beautiful and special my walk to and from the train station was! I worked on several interesting cases, including this high-profile antitrust case against two big publishing 
                    houses where Stephen King testified at trial (learn more about the trial <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2022-08-02/stephen-king-testified-against-publishings-biggest-merger-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-antitrust-trial">here</a>).

                <h3>Software Programming and Development</h3>
                <p>While working as a Court Manager, I spearheaded the development and implementation of a new web-based case management system. I worked very closely with the software engineers and completely fell in love
                    with what they were able to accomplish and I was fascinated by <em>how</em> they accomplished it. 
                    <h4>SheCodes</h4>
                        <p>I took a coding bootcamp in January 2022 and briefly leared basis HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
                    <h4>Shopify Dev Degree</h4>
                        <p> Following my completiong of "Into to Coding", I knew that this was something I wanted to pursue. I began researching the best way to completely
                            change your career, and I stumbled upon Shopify's Dev Degree program. I applied in February 2022. It is now 
                            August of 2022 and I still cannot believe that I was selected into the Dev Degree program (ahem, Imposter Syndrome!). I am so lucky to have this
                            opportunity and I am so excited to be challenged on a daily basis and to use the creative side of my brain again!</p>
